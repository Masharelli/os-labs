Well this proyect let me a lot of thing in the perspective of learning, because when i know about this sounds really difficult,
was really easy to do, only i had some problems with memory in the VM, but nothing to worry, at the end it was i really good learnig
stuff, because the code example was good explained so was easy to understand. In another hand I learned a lot with this and 
i'm curious to serch more about OS so was really placent.

In coclusion in this proyect we applied most of the knowledge we learned during the course applying it to a real life
situation which was making a working operating system. I really liked this proyect because it merged all the topics into one big cluster
