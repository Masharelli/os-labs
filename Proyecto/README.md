 # The CODE

So we know the theory, and we have our tools ready. What now? Code? Well... before putting finger to keyboard, it's a good idea for us to take a step back and think about what we have to work with.

## Freestanding - What Does This Mean?

I've already mentioned that we're running our code 'freestanding'. But what does this mean, and how will it affect us? It's important you know. Normally when you write C code in a hosted environment, you have a plethora or interfaces available to you. You can read from files, you can output messages, you can get user input... All with just a few lines of code. Sadly, we don't have that. Those things are provided by an operating system. And right now, we don't have one since we ARE the operating system.

What we DO have access to however is a few useful headers GCC automatically provides us with (they give us things like fixed-width integers) and the hardware of the x86. We'd like to output text, so for that we're going to write ourselves a very simple driver that interacts with the x86's VGA buffer and allows us to display text on the screen. In doing this, we'll have to avoid using anything like the C standard library, because it simply isn't available when we're compiling for a freestanding target like we are now.


So without further ado... Let's start programming!

## The Project Structure

Please remember, this is a minimal setup. A more advanced kernel project will have a more complex code structure, as well as an automated build system.

For now, we'll be creating 3 files in our project directory. They are: 
```
start.s     - This file will contain our x86 assembly code that starts our kernel and sets up the x86
kernel.c    - This file will contain the majority of our kernel, written in C
linker.ld   - This file will give the compiler information about how it should construct our kernel executable by linking the previous files together
```
## start.s 
```// We declare the 'kernel_main' label as being external to this file.
// That's because it's the name of the main C function in 'kernel.c'.
.extern kernel_main
 
// We declare the 'start' label as global (accessible from outside this file), since the linker will need to know where it is.
// In a bit, we'll actually take a look at the code that defines this label.
.global start
 
// Our bootloader, GRUB, needs to know some basic information about our kernel before it can boot it.
// We give GRUB this information using a standard known as 'Multiboot'.
// To define a valid 'Multiboot header' that will be recognised by GRUB, we need to hard code some
// constants into the executable. The following code calculates those constants.
.set MB_MAGIC, 0x1BADB002          // This is a 'magic' constant that GRUB will use to detect our kernel's location.
.set MB_FLAGS, (1 << 0) | (1 << 1) // This tells GRUB to 1: load modules on page boundaries and 2: provide a memory map (this is useful later in development)
// Finally, we calculate a checksum that includes all the previous values
.set MB_CHECKSUM, (0 - (MB_MAGIC + MB_FLAGS))
 
// We now start the section of the executable that will contain our Multiboot header
.section .multiboot
	.align 4 // Make sure the following data is aligned on a multiple of 4 bytes
	// Use the previously calculated constants in executable code
	.long MB_MAGIC
	.long MB_FLAGS
	// Use the checksum we calculated earlier
	.long MB_CHECKSUM
 
// This section contains data initialised to zeroes when the kernel is loaded
.section .bss
	// Our C code will need a stack to run. Here, we allocate 4096 bytes (or 4 Kilobytes) for our stack.
	// We can expand this later if we want a larger stack. For now, it will be perfectly adequate.
	.align 16
	stack_bottom:
		.skip 4096 // Reserve a 4096-byte (4K) stack
	stack_top:
 
// This section contains our actual assembly code to be run when our kernel loads
.section .text
	// Here is the 'start' label we mentioned before. This is the first code that gets run in our kernel.
	start:
		// First thing's first: we want to set up an environment that's ready to run C code.
		// C is very relaxed in its requirements: All we need to do is to set up the stack.
		// Please note that on x86, the stack grows DOWNWARD. This is why we start at the top.
		mov $stack_top, %esp // Set the stack pointer to the top of the stack
 
		// Now we have a C-worthy (haha!) environment ready to run the rest of our kernel.
		// At this point, we can call our main C function.
		call kernel_main
 
		// If, by some mysterious circumstances, the kernel's C code ever returns, all we want to do is to hang the CPU
		hang:
			cli      // Disable CPU interrupts
			hlt      // Halt the CPU
			jmp hang // If that didn't work, loop around and try again.
   ```
   ## Kernel.c
   ```
   // GCC provides these header files automatically
// They give us access to useful things like fixed-width types
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
 
// First, let's do some basic checks to make sure we are using our x86-elf cross-compiler correctly
#if defined(__linux__)
	#error "This code must be compiled with a cross-compiler"
#elif !defined(__i386__)
	#error "This code must be compiled with an x86-elf compiler"
#endif
 
// This is the x86's VGA textmode buffer. To display text, we write data to this memory location
volatile uint16_t* vga_buffer = (uint16_t*)0xB8000;
// By default, the VGA textmode buffer has a size of 80x25 characters
const int VGA_COLS = 80;
const int VGA_ROWS = 25;
 
// We start displaying text in the top-left of the screen (column = 0, row = 0)
int term_col = 0;
int term_row = 0;
uint8_t term_color = 0x0F; // Black background, White foreground
 
// This function initiates the terminal by clearing it
void term_init()
{
	// Clear the textmode buffer
	for (int col = 0; col < VGA_COLS; col ++)
	{
		for (int row = 0; row < VGA_ROWS; row ++)
		{
			// The VGA textmode buffer has size (VGA_COLS * VGA_ROWS).
			// Given this, we find an index into the buffer for our character
			const size_t index = (VGA_COLS * row) + col;
			// Entries in the VGA buffer take the binary form BBBBFFFFCCCCCCCC, where:
			// - B is the background color
			// - F is the foreground color
			// - C is the ASCII character
			vga_buffer[index] = ((uint16_t)term_color << 8) | ' '; // Set the character to blank (a space character)
		}
	}
}
 
// This function places a single character onto the screen
void term_putc(char c)
{
	// Remember - we don't want to display ALL characters!
	switch (c)
	{
	case '\n': // Newline characters should return the column to 0, and increment the row
		{
			term_col = 0;
			term_row ++;
			break;
		}
 
	default: // Normal characters just get displayed and then increment the column
		{
			const size_t index = (VGA_COLS * term_row) + term_col; // Like before, calculate the buffer index
			vga_buffer[index] = ((uint16_t)term_color << 8) | c;
			term_col ++;
			break;
		}
	}
 
	// What happens if we get past the last column? We need to reset the column to 0, and increment the row to get to a new line
	if (term_col >= VGA_COLS)
	{
		term_col = 0;
		term_row ++;
	}
 
	// What happens if we get past the last row? We need to reset both column and row to 0 in order to loop back to the top of the screen
	if (term_row >= VGA_ROWS)
	{
		term_col = 0;
		term_row = 0;
	}
}
 
// This function prints an entire string onto the screen
void term_print(const char* str)
{
	for (size_t i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i ++) // Keep placing characters until we hit the null-terminating character ('\0')
		term_putc(str[i]);
}
 
 
 
// This is our kernel's main function
void kernel_main()
{
	// We're here! Let's initiate the terminal and display a message to show we got here.
 
	// Initiate terminal
	term_init();
 
	// Display some messages
	term_print("Hello, World!\n");
	term_print("Welcome to the kernel.\n");
